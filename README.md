🚀 Below are some of my cybersecurity projects showcasing my skills in threat detection, forensic analysis, and security engineering.

### Finished
🔹 Network Intrusion Detection with Suricata

Set up Suricata IDS to detect malicious traffic.

Created custom rules to identify Nmap scans & exploits.

Used Evebox & Kibana to analyze logs and improve detection.

🔹Phishing Email Investigation (Online Tools) 🔎

A concise, web-based analysis of a phishing email (titled “Confirmation receipt ID_66972”).

Demonstrates how to manually review and flag a suspicious email as malicious in PhishTool, 

plus a CAPE Sandbox check via VirusTotal, including an exported HTML report with detailed malicious indicators.

🔹SOC Log Analysis & Threat Hunting in Graylog

This project showcases log analysis and threat hunting using Graylog, an open-source SIEM alternative to Splunk. 
The focus is on monitoring authentication logs, detecting security anomalies, 
and visualizing insights via dashboards.

### Ongoing Projects

🔹 DFIR-Simulated Nation State Attack

This project simulates a sophisticated nation-state sponsored supply chain attack and the subsequent digital forensics 
and incident response (DFIR) investigation. Designed as a portfolio piece for a GitHub repository, the project demonstrates 
advanced cybersecurity skills in attack simulation, forensic analysis, threat hunting, and remediation within a controlled lab environment.
